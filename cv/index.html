RESEARCH OVERVIEW
Primary project:
Dissecting the genetic basis of carbohydrate partitioning in maize (Zea mays) using molecular, physiological, genetic, and genomic methods. Two families of mutants exhibiting defects in carbohydrate partitioning are currently being characterized. Genes identified from this project may be future targets for crop improvement for increasing yield and bio-fuel production.
 Collaborative projects:
Identification and annotation of gene families involved in sucrose transport in wild and modern species of Saccharum sp. (sugarcane) using in silico analyses to understand the major sucrose transporters which may contribute to high sugar content in modern sugarcane cultivars.
 Understanding the effect of altered cell wall and sugar content on Sorghum bicolor (sorghum)-associated pathogenic bacteria (Xanthomonas) to reveal the mechanisms underlying tolerance to pathogens and impact of bioenergy relevant traits on pathogen susceptibility. Currently, involved in assessing sugar and starch content under various infection conditions in various sorghum accessions.
